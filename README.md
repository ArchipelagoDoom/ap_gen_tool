# APDoom GenTool

Version 2.0; supports automatic .apworld generation.


## Why was this split off from APDoom?

Having this in the main repository was adding a _lot_ of extra complexity to the build system, especially on Windows due to APCpp and Onut both trying to bundle zlib for themselves. Splitting this tool off into its own repository should hopefully make setting up both projects significantly easier.
